Standard: Players are randomly placed. No special rules.

Utopia: Players are all placed on the outer parts of the map. This way everbody is further away from each other and it takes longer for war to break out.

Instant Chaos: The opposite of Utopia. Everybody starts in the middle of the map, close to each other.

Clash of the Titans: Everybody starts with a level 10 hero.

Heirs to an Ancient Power: Everybody starts with a hero who has an insanely powerful artifact (like a bow that gives +5 Leadership and +8 Missiles).

North vs South: Creates two teams of 4 players. They will be allied to each other and at war with the other team. One team starts in the north, the other in the south.

Two Against the World: Creates a team of 2 players vs a team of 6 players. The 2 players start in the middle of the map.

Hammer and Anvil: Again creates a team of 2 players vs a team of 6 players. But this time the two player start on opposite sides of the map.

Against the Horde: One player is "the horde" and has a lot of cities on one side of the map and is at war with everybody else. Everybody else is allied with eachother.

Crusaders: I'm a little uncertain, but this seems to be similair to Against the Horde, except that players seem to start in random positions instead of having a team on each side of the map.
