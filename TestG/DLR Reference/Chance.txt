COST
Cost is based on the strength of the Mercenary unit (from 1 to 9)
When 'n' units are received, the cost is (n*cost)
Normal: 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500
Renown +1: 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250
Renown +2: 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250
Renown +3: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200
Renown +4: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200
Renown +5: 1, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 150

So you can see that when you have renouned +5, a 9 strength merc costs 150 gold each while a 5 strength costs 15 each. 
Thus it makes sense to never have mercs with a higher strength than say 6 which at renouned +1 cost 100 gold and drop to 20 gold at renouned +5. 
Assassins at 1 strength and 50% assassination are by FAR the super cheapest option in Merc 3 since each only only costs 1-5 gold regardless of your renouned level.
