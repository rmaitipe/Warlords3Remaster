BUG FIXES

1.02 is a small patch to fix 2 important bugs in 1.01 (as well as
  introduce two new minor features):
a) Summoned Armies no longer drown over water.
b) Curse now works correctly.
c) No more "Super Mercs" can be obtained in cities near shrines.

NEW RULES

QUESTS
"Slay Units" quests only accumulate 1/2 point per unit killed while
  DEFENDING.

RANDOM MAPS
Barracks & Ranger Towers (along with different castles) are now
  available (50% of the time) in Random Maps.

1.01 Update

Additions

NEW RULES

COMBAT
4hp Fliers are no longer immune to archery.
Archers gain a +3 bonus to strength when fighting fliers.
Curse now takes place before poison/disease/paralysis, which means that
  blessed units can be cursed AND poisoned in the same combat.
Poison now subtracts up to 2 points from an army's strength, not 1.
Note: Disease is applied before the Banding bonus.  This makes 1 Str
  armies like Peasants and Rats immune to Poison even though their
  Banding bonus may give them Strength greater than 1.

CUSTOM ARMY SETS
It is now increasingly difficult to put Dragons into a custom set in any
  location except Ally-4, maybe Ally-3, and maybe one Regular Slot.
Armies which are called forth from summoning spells no longer need to be
  in your army set.

QUEST REWARD
Rewards of allies & Merc's are now based on production times.  You might
  get 12 turns of production from an Average quest which would be 2
  Dragons, 3 Fire Demons, or 4 Griffons.  This should reduce the
  proliferation of Dragons and other powerful allies, which has marred
  many online games.

MISCELLANEOUS BUG FIXES / FEATURES
Capture the flag items no longer appear in 2 places (on their owner and
  in a ruin!).
A secondary spellcaster in a stack can now cast Teleport on his whole
  group by using the "Re-group" button on the "Cast Spell" screen.
Produces an optional log file to aid in detection of cheaters (you
  access this via "Darklord.exe -log").
Miscellaneous combat bugs fixed :
  Warding now waorks for attackers AND defenders.
  Acid/Lightning getting multiple shots vs assassin and missile troops
    has been fixed.
  Trample "appearing" to do more points of damage than it actually does
    is fixed.
  Invisible armies popping up after a combat is over.
  Paralyzed troops now get ALL 5 movement points back when blessed.
  Quest reward stealing bug fixed.
  Text & data errors in some of the Campaigns fixed.
  "Speed" now only gives a group 150% movement allowance, not 200%.
  You can now change a player's details in Email games (from the Email
    Stat's Dialog).
  The Right-Click popup-bonus-display has Slayer Info + Group Warding/
    Lightning/Acid/Life Drain info.
  Right-Click hero-popup (from the stack palette) now lists more
    abilities & spells (7 instead of 4).

NEW ABILITIES
These abilities are used in conjunction with the hero balancing.  Some
  are in the form of spells, other are buyable abilities.

Group Warding +N - Provides a warding bonus to every army in the stack.
  Goes no higher than +3.
Life Drain +N - Subtracts from the hit points of every enemy army in
  combat.  As a spell effect, this is +1 for levels 1-8 & +2 for levels
  9-10.
Mana Drain - Drains a point of mana income from every other side, adding
  it to your own.
Questing  - Gain double XP from quests.
Group Lightning +N - Provides a lightning ability for every unit in the
  stack.
Group Acid +N  - Provides an acid ability for every unit in the stack.
Necromancy +N - After a successful combat the victor raises some undead
  (Skeletons, Wights, Wraiths, Undead Beasts, or Undead Dragons)
  automatically from the battlefield.  The number & quality of the
  creatures depends on the hero's level of Necromancy.
Renown +N - Any hero with Renown, when starting his turn in a city, has
  a much higher chance of attracting merc's which are better quality &
  cheaper (depending upon his level of Renown).  Note that you must have
  "Get Mercenaries" enabled to receive this reward.
Shatter - Breaks items within a given radius.  The power of the item
  which can be broken, is dependent upon the level of the caster of the
  Shatter spell.
Dispel Magic - Dispels spells within a given radius.  The affected
  spells must be on a hero of level less than the level of the caster.
Banish - Dispels any summoned creatures within a given radius.  The
  turn-production-time of the creature to be dispelled must be less than
  or equal to half the level of the caster.
Slayer - There are 8 slayer abilities, one for each of the following
  groups of creatures: Dragonslayer, Demonslayer, Deathslayer,
  Manslayer, Dwarfslayer, Elfslayer, Gnollslayer.  When a hero has a
  slayer ability, then EVERY unit in his stack gets a chance to SLAY an
  enemy of a given type on a successful strike in combat.  Chances are
  based on the hero's level: 1-4:10%, 5-7:20%, 8-9:30%, 10:40%.  A
  slayer Item increases this chance by +20%.  A slayer Spell increases
  it by +10/20/30% depending upon the level of the caster.
