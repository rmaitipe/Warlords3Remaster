APPENDIX 3: SPELLS
The list of spells for Darklords Rising is kept intentionally small to
avoid having dozens of spells which no player will ever use. Of the ten
hero classes included
in the game, only four can cast a lot of spells:
   wizards, priests, necromancers, shamans
While 3 further classes get a few spells:
   paladins, rangers, vampires
The higher level a spell-caster obtains, the more effect his spell has:
Level Bonus
1-5    + 1
6-8    + 2
9-10   + 3

Note: Some spells such as movement bonuses do not take effect until the start
of the turn after they are thrown.
